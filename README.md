# Translation Project

This project focuses on translating Arabizi (Tunisian dialect written in Latin script) to English using a custom fine-tuned model.

## Project Overview

The model was fine-tuned on a dataset specifically curated for translating Arabizi to English. This dataset contains about 1300 lines of text, with columns for Arabizi (`tounsi`) and the corresponding English translation (`english`).

## Example Translation
